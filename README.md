# Quick Links
* [Visit the website](https://brenclen.github.io/uvic-links/)
* Quick Links is a small web app that aggregates my current semesters courses links as well as other relevant/useful University links.

# NOTE:
* Many of these buttons/links contain URL's requiring authentication which will very-likely lead to limited/no access.

## Utilizes
* Media queries to dynamically resize the page based on whether I'm on desktop or mobile.
* Some funky hover options.
* Mostly CSS flexbox everything.
* No CSS frameworks.
